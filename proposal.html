"In the particular is contained the universal."

# Journalism/Documentary

I believe that the field of journalism and documentary have much to gain with regards to new media.

Journalism thrives on the particular. I believe that this particularity can be enhanced greatly with new media, and in lock-step, journalism itself can be enhanced.

# Project Plan

- Create a piece of journalism & documentary.

- Build a platform, or perhaps a working calculus for dynamic, media-rich journalism.

# Some Specifics, Early Ideas

- Do NOT require the user to sit through load/buffer screens, however short they may be. Flow!

- Info Vis

    Where the written word fails, use information graphics (paper.js, D3.js). Numerical data - this includes anything from soil composition to personal timelines - are typically best expressed visually, as opposed to prose.

- "Dress the story."

    Create profiles/dossiers for persons of interest that relay important information.
    Have these profiles be placed congruent to their appearance in the text. They should both be highlighted when the mouse hovers over them. Similarly link these profiles to any video they appear in. The idea is to combine text, the static image, and the moving image, to create an "intratextual" experience for the user.
