# The New Aesthetic

Thoughts on "An Essay on the New Aesthetic" by Bruce Sterling

Kevin Volkl

# The New Aesthetic

I never quite understood the classificatory disputes with regards to art, literature, etc. I understand the reasoning behind a taxonomical approach of sorts - the fragmentation of modernism, the subversion of postmodernism - it makes sense to understand the history, reasoning, things of this nature. But this inevitably gives way to gung ho cultural theorists (see post-postmodernism, post-irony, etc.).

Bruce Sterling is certainly no "gung ho cultural theorist", however. That said, I still find the New Aesthetic to be esoteric, particularly when he begins to criticize AI, and twentieth century ideas. I understand these criticisms and actually find them quite interesting (particularly how we limit ourselves by thinking of computation in old 20th century terms), but I feel like he's nipping around the bud and won't describe what exactly the New Aesthetic is attempting to be. He describes it as ardently contemporary, then describes pixelation as a defining aspect of it, then criticises pixel art as old again! I agree with his conclusion that there's something here, but it isn't fully fleshed out.
