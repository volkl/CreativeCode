# VR

Thoughts on Virtual Reality

Kevin Volkl

# False Start

VR has had more false starts than any cinematic technology in recent memory. I'm looking at you, Nintendo.

Jokes aside, I think the Virtual Boy is a perfect example of how VR's growth was stunted by an imbalance between technology and vision (vision, not in the literal sense). The Verge aritcle touches on this; many of the early pioneers in the field, though integral to VR's development, were chasing something that just wasn't feasible yet.

# Why now?

Now that the tech might be here, it seems like this proliferation may indeed be on the horizon. I don't say this because of the technology (though I DO believe in it now), but because it is better financed than ever before. That is to say, Facebook has skin in the game now (to the tune of 2 billion dollars).

# Install Base

That said, there is a difficult obstacle for VR to overcome. First - how do you market something that is unable to be experienced throguh conventional modes of advertising? Set up kiosks in brick and mortar stores? 

Assuming one COULD market this, Zuckerberg stated that it would require 50-100 million units sold to make VR a meaningful platform. The Mozilla piece supposed that this would happen in 5 years. To put that into context, the Playstation 2 (the best selling videogame console of all time) sold 100 million units in 5 years and 9 months. You can quote me on this - not only will no single VR system move 50 million units by 2020, but the aggregate of all first-party VR systems put together will have an install base of fewer than 50 million. I hope I'm wrong, but I just don't see it.

# Chicken or the Egg?

Zuckerberg isn't wrong - a 50 million unit install base would spur software developers to actually DEVELOP for these platforms. But without a killer app, reaching that mark seems unfeasible to me. 

I think there's already a vibrant ecosystem for VR, but it is truly a tall order to get 50 million people to purchase an unknown quantity like this. If it can manage to get over that hump, I think the near future could be very bright for VR. If it can't...it may meet the same fate as the Virtual Boy.
