# net.art

Thoughts on "The Internet as Art" & "Critical Making"

Kevin Volkl

# The Internet as Art

I'm not going to get anywhere near the question "what is art", but it's interesting to see how net.art seems to be blending utility and consequence with the traditional, classicist, aesthetic idea of "art." My first instict is to say that a computer virus is not art any more than "fuck" written on a bathroom wall is art. But this can be picked apart quite easily and these classificatory disputes usually reveal less about what art is, and more about personal philosophies. This may or may not be perverse. I'll mercifully side-step that discussion and move onwards. 

Wachter and Jud's "www.picdae.net" (the site that allows users to upload blocked webpages from China, Iran, Africa, etc.) is interesting because it reminded me, in a way, of Jackson Pollock (bear with me). My mom is much more knowledgeable about art than I, and when I was young and asked her why Pollock painted this way, and why it was acclaimed so, she compared it to language. Verbal language is a rather crude and limited mode of communication - we're often speechless, and at a loss for words because there are only so many words and combinations of words that convey something correctly, if at all. Pollock's painting is, in a way, a reaction to this - a transcendent self-expression. If you're still awake, I mean that picdae similarly undermines restriction by translating one form of communication (machine-readable code) to another (pixels, images). Jury's out on whether or not this qualifies as art, but it's interesting nonetheless.

# Critical Making

-- "why in fact does ‘critical thinking’ seem such a common-sense term, while ‘critical making’ seems odd to most of us?"

For someone who stresses making and materiality over abstract critical thought, this article is punishngly abstract. I had to read this with supressed violence. I actually quite like media theory, but I also like competent rhetoric.

Snark aside, he has a point. If I had to guess, society, progress, the generation of new ideas - whatever you want to call it - has taken to critical thinking because the mind is essentially a super computer. He admits the difficulties of critical making (his classroom has no sinks, ventilation for soddering) in that making is just naturally a more arduous process. But I'd be remiss to say that materiality isn't important to scholarship  and art. God knows this article needs it.
