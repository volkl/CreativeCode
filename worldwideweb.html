# Tim Berners-Lee

THE WORLD WIDE WEB RESPONSE

Kevin Volkl

---

# Thoughts

Even more so than the Vannevar Bush article, I think Berners-Lee's vision of the future was prophetic. Unlike Bush's precursory shrunken encyclopedia, Berners-Lee's vision of the web, though still gestating, proved to be quite realized at that point. The screenshots of the system in use, navigating some CERN pages looks fairly similar to the web as it exists now.

I don't quite understand the reasoning behind the paper's rejection (not enough academic bloviating)? I'm also not as familiar with the web's peers that the introduction was referring to. Seeing as how 1), we're reading this, and 2) the world wide web's ubiquity is undenaible, I'll assume that this system gained a large, large market share very soon after this.

His prediction of the future that the web could bring is still being realized now. He even mentions VR at one point, which is hilariously anachronistic for the 1990s, but ultimately true today.
