# 2000 - The Dot-com Bubble

In '97, the speculative marked predicted that the internet was a bottomless pit of cash. Tech start ups had very little risk and high reward. A company like Google could take in $100,000 in venture capital while promising their investors $1,000,000. Unfortunately, investors who were used to brick-and-mortar business knew very little about how exactly the internet works. We were all in the dark at this time.

# Therein lies the problem...

At the time of the crash in March 2000, tech stock indexes were peaking at nearly double their value the previous year. The Wall Street Journal ran an article that precipitated the crash, arguing that the internet is not profitable and advising divestment.

---

# How did it happen?

Though incredibly lucrative (clearly), the business was never as good as people were lead to believe. Instead of focusing on sales, the lion's share of tech startups wanted to make money providing free services. This involves heavy advertising, and investors were promised millions of "hits" - at the time, a rather unknown quantity.

Hits were likened to a billboard that millions of people would see every day, but the metrics were all off. Hits and unique visitors are not equitable, and people were all ready being conditioned to ignore pop-up ads. Tons of money was lost in revenue, and the WSJ article was published.

Of course, companies like Google survived and today collect and sell information en masse. In a sense, the dot-com bubble taught us how the internet worked, just a bit more.

---

# Moral of the story?

The internet is not in and of itself, a money-printing machine. One must provide tangible, or real-world services and applications.

---

# Today?

A lot of people question whether or not today's dangerous business practices could spell another crash. Free content on a massive scale could mark a "race to the bottom", as it were. Bitcoin and digital currencies are similarly questionable.

Regardless, the dot-com bubble and the few years following it have taught us quite a bit about the internet and its value, both financially and practically.

# Epilogue - It's not all avarice and failure!

In the wake of the crash, some immensely influential websites started cropping up that really provided some incredibly powerful tools, tools that defined what the internet could be.

Lawrence Lessig and Aaron Swartz pioneered Creative Commons, a non-profit that seeks to expand the range of creative works available for legal use and sharing.

Jimmy Wales founded Wikipedia, a website that I maintain is one of the greatest, most accessible learning resources in the history of man.

Mark Zuckerburg created Facebook, one of the most ubiquitous communication platforms today.
