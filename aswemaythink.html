Thoughts on "As We May Think"

Kevin Volkl

---

# Before Hypertext

Heretofor, data was typically arranged alphabetically and numerically.

---

# Aardvark...Zyzzyva

This was helpful - humans sought data by adhering to the order of the alphabet and of numbers.

---

# A Post-War Meditation

Yet, as the "collective knowledge" grows infinitely larger, and equally impressive technological feats are achieved, it was necessary to reevaluate the ways we order our knowledge.

---

# Dictatorial Libraries

There was something authoritarian about these old ways of thinking. Novels, music, academic texts - everything was assigned a symbol arbitrary to its meaning and context.

---

# Hypertext!

With the advent of hypertext, many trusted epistemological methods were reshaped.

---

# "As We May Think"

Bush (now quite prophetically) proposed that we are better served to traverse this new gargantuan wealth of knowledge by qualitative means - on our own terms, "as we may think."

# The Human Mind

"The human mind does not work that way. It operates by association. With one item in its grasp, it snaps instantly to the next that is suggested by the association of thoughts, in accordance with some intricate web of trails carried by the cells of the brain. It has other characteristics, of course; trails that are not frequently followed are prone to fade, items are not fully permanent, memory is transitory. Yet the speed of action, the intricacy of trails, the detail of mental pictures, is awe-inspiring beyond all else in nature."

--Vannevar Bush
